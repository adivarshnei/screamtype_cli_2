# screamtype_cli_2

So, I forgot that I had previously made [screamtype](https://github.com/adivarshnei/screamtype-cli/). When I changed my personal laptop, I somehow forgot to transfer the project to my new laptop, and therefore ended up remaking it.

A new fun thing I added to this version was an ability to launch a new iTerm2 window using `launch.py`. Use `make` to create the binary and then launch it as so:

```zsh
python3 launch.py scream
```
